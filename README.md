## Scope of improvement -
- Menu Sidebar -
  - When a menu item is selected, the item gets highlighted. But, when another item is selected after that, the previously selected item should become inactive.
  - The submenu items should also get highlighted when clicked on.
  - The submenu items should be collapsible/expandable when clicked on.
 
- Calculated Summary Section -
  - The calculated values could be dynamically calculated from the table data. Currently, it's hardcoded.
 
- Table -
  - A sorting functionality could be implemented to sort the 'Vendor Name' column.
  - A tooltip could be added in the 'Order Value' column header, when hovering on the 'i' button.
